# Checkpoint â€” 2025-10-23 08:10 PT

**Scope**
- Executed `service-ci` workflow (build, push, terraform apply) via `gh workflow run ...`.
- Hardened deploy IAM role permissions for ECR, DynamoDB, IAM, and SSM interactions.
- Added App Runner access role wiring and disabled observability to satisfy API requirements.
- Confirmed AWS resources provisioned: DynamoDB table `dodeck`, App Runner service `dodeck-api`, SSM SecureString params.

**Diff highlights**
- `.github/workflows/service.yml`: now installs Terraform, ensures backend config, and orchestrates build+apply.
- `infra/terraform/modules/apprunner`: introduced ECR access role, authentication config, observability update.
- `infra/terraform/envs/dev`: switched to data-driven ECR lookup, added repository name variable.
- IAM deploy policy applied out-of-band to include required AWS permissions.

**Evidence**
- `gh run watch 18741630014 -R ryanlatham/dodeck` (successful deploy).
- App Runner URL: `https://skcdqfw5pt.us-west-2.awsapprunner.com`.
- AWS CLI: `aws dynamodb describe-table dodeck`, `aws apprunner list-services`.

**Risks / Follow-ups**
- Need staging/prod environments and promotion logic (separate backend configs, workflows).
- Monitoring/alerting for App Runner & DynamoDB not yet configured.
- IAM deploy policy maintained manually; move into Terraform-orchestrated IAM module to codify permissions.
